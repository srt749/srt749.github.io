The following plugin commands allow the developer to search through
existing notes for a specific string. The search is not case sensitive,
so any result (upper or lower case) that matches is returned.

   <>notepad search [v] titles for [string]
   <>notepad search [v] key [key] for [string]
   <>notepad search [v] details for [string]

[v] --> Game Variable ID to store the string in, if found.
If not found, this will be set to an empty string. This can also be used for
a true/false test, because an empty string is a falsy value.

[string] --> What you would like to search for.

[key] --> Unique key of a note, if you want to search a specific note.

Examples:
   <>notepad search 19 titles for Once upon a time...
   <>notepad search 20 key recipes for Super Potion
   <>notepad search 18 details for Shaken, not Stirred.

$gameVariables.value(19) will contain the string "Once upon a time..." if found.
$gameVariables.value(20) will contain the string "Super Potion" if found.
$gameVariables.value(18) will contain the string "Shaken, not Stirred" if found.

If any of these strings are not found, the value in the game variable is set to 0.

$gameNotepad.searchKey(key, term, variableId)
-- Searches through a specific note to see if it contains the term
--- key: the unique key of the note to search
--- term: the term/words/characters to look for
--- variableId: the title/details is saved to this variable if found

$gameNotepad.disableFeature(feature)
-- Disables the given feature of the notepad
--- feature: new, modify, or delete

  <>notepad search 11 details 11 for string
